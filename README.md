
# Multiplayer in ct.js!
This is a catmod to enable the use of the [Nakama JS Client library](https://heroiclabs.com/docs/javascript-client-guide/) into the [ct.js game engine](https://ctjs.rocks/). You can now build a fully scalable multiplayer game all with the amazing tools ct.js provides!

Nakama makes it possible to create virtually any type of multiplayer experience you desire. Here are some of its features:

 - Low latency realtime engine
 - Server-authoritative multiplayer
 - Match listing and lobby rooms
 - Leaderboards
 - Social sign-in: Facebook, Google, and more
 - Realtime, room-based, persisted chat channels
 - [And a lot more!](https://heroiclabs.com/)

## Notice:
This catmod is still in the very early stages of development.  **It is not production ready!** I plan to create documentation, examples and a tutorial series to go through how to use this library all in the near future once the codebase gets stable.

Any feedback is welcome and I am super excited to what we can build with this. 


## Getting Started:

 1. You'll need a [local instance of a Nakama server](https://heroiclabs.com/docs/nakama-download/) before you begin.
2. Download the latest release of this catmod.
3. Import the module into ct.js in the `Catmods` section.
4. You should be all set! üöÄ


## Example Usage:
‚ö†Ô∏è Not all properties and functions have been documented! 

You can access the global variable called `Nokama` anywhere in ct.js. This is the class which provides you with all the functionality of Nokama.

|`Nakama.client`  |Returns the client|
|`Nakama.session`| Returns the current client session
|`Nakama.socket`  |Returns the current socket connection to the server|
|`Nakama.currentMatch`  |Returns the current match, null if client is not in a game|
|`Nakama.connectedOpponents`  |Returns a list of all connected players in the match|
|`Nakama.appendToConnectedOpponents(list)`  |Takes list of clients and appends them to `Nakama.connectedOpponents`|
|`Nakama.removeFromConnectedOpponents(list)`  |Takes list of clients and removes them from `Nakama.connectedOpponents`|

### Create a match
From https://heroiclabs.com/docs/gameplay-multiplayer-realtime/#create-a-match
```
let response = await Nakama.socket.createMatch();
console.log("Created match with ID:", response.match.match_id);
```

### Join a match
From https://heroiclabs.com/docs/gameplay-multiplayer-realtime/#join-a-match
```
let id = "<matchid>";
Nakama.currentMatch = await Nakama.socket.joinMatch(id);
Nakama.connectedOpponents = match.presences

Nakama.connectedOpponents.forEach((opponent) => {
  console.log("User id %o, username %o.", opponent.user_id, opponent.username);
});
```

## Getting Help
Please open any issue such as bugs üêõ or feature requests ‚ú® on GitHub.  You can find me on the [ct.js Discord](https://discord.gg/Egwh9ETmJF) as well if you want to chat :)

## Contributing 
All contribution is welcome. Like I mentioned, this is still in the early days of a development, there's no roadmap, no planned features, just me working on it as I go along. 

If you'd like to build this yourself:
 1. Clone the repo
 2. `npm install`
 3. `npm build`
 5. A `dist` folder gets created with a zip for ct.js
